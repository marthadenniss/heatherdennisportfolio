  <p>Terrence Wilson’s mother, Madelene Wilson, was the lead singer in the rock group Baby Jane and the Rockabyes. His father, Clarence Wilson, sang with the Wilson Brothers, an a cappella quintet specializing in rock and R&B.</p>

  <p>One day, young Terrence turned to a classical music station from their Bronx home and became mesmerized by the three Bs: Beethoven, Bach, and Brahms. “By the time I was 8 or 9 or so, I discovered classical music on the radio, WNCN ... and that’s what got me drawn to classical music,” Wilson recalls.</p>

  <p>Now 50, Wilson earns his living as a pianist, having made his orchestral debut as a teen. Among the early performances was George Gershwin’s <em>Rhapsody in Blue</em> — a piece he’ll perform again this weekend with the Toledo Symphony Orchestra.</p>

  <h2>100 Years of <em>Rhapsody in Blue</em></h2>
  <p>The TSO will mark the 100th anniversary of Gershwin’s groundbreaking composition in Masterworks concerts Friday and Saturday at the Toledo Museum of Art Peristyle. Also on the program: Jessie Montgomery’s <em>Banner</em> and Aaron Copland’s <em>Symphony No. 3</em>.</p>

  <p>The piece debuted in February 1924 at Manhattan’s Aeolian Hall with a packed house and a thunderous ovation. Gershwin, only 25 at the time, wrote the rhapsody in just five weeks after his brother Ira spotted an article falsely claiming George was already composing a jazz concerto.</p>

  <p>“A rhapsody ... is a free form ... where the composer can express a musical stream of consciousness,” Wilson explained. “It’s just kind of a form where the piece flows on its own terms.”</p>

  <h2>Jazz, Classical, and Criticism</h2>
  <p>Though Gershwin didn’t invent jazz or the blues, critics have long debated whether he appropriated the work of Black composers like Scott Joplin. Still, many argue that Gershwin’s aim was unity.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“He didn’t invent jazz ... All he was saying was: take a look at this entire thing that is America — Black and white, rich and poor … This is the sound of us.” — <strong>Bill Charlap</strong>, William Paterson University</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>While critics have also questioned the construction and jazz authenticity of the piece, its iconic opening clarinet glissando remains unforgettable.</p>

  <p>“You almost think of getting out of bed ... and having this big yawn and stretch,” Wilson said of the piece’s whimsical introduction.</p>

  <h2>Gershwin and the Greats</h2>
  <p>After the success of <em>Rhapsody in Blue</em>, Gershwin sought more formal training and met Maurice Ravel. The French composer turned him down, fearing he’d corrupt Gershwin’s natural talent.</p>

  <p>“It would probably cause him to write ‘bad Ravel’ and lose his gift of melody and spontaneity,” mezzo-soprano Eva Gauthier once recounted.</p>

  <p>Wilson, who has played the piece since he was a teen, never tires of it. “It’s like an old friend to me,” he said.</p>
