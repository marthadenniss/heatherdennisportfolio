  <p>Welcome to my portfolio website!</p>

<section id="about">
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I’m an award-winning journalist, editor, and storyteller with more than 30 years of experience in newsrooms across Northwest Ohio. Known for my sharp news judgment, clever headlines, and deep respect for the English language, I bring heart, humor, and clarity to everything I edit or write.

    I currently serve as a copy editor at The Blade in Toledo, Ohio, where I’ve worked since 1994. My work includes editing stories for accuracy, style, grammar, and visual impact. Over the years, I’ve written hundreds of local features and news stories, and I spent several years designing the Opinion pages.
    
    Since 2021, I’ve written the weekly “Classics” column, where I spotlight classical music events, performers, and organizations in the region — including the Toledo Opera, Toledo Symphony, and a wide range of community ensembles. My goal is to blend thoughtful previews, vibrant storytelling, and curated event listings that showcase the area’s musical talent.
    
    I’m also a published fiction writer. My short stories have appeared in various literary outlets, and my debut novel, Sherman’s March to the Sea, reflects my love of language and layered narratives. A second novel is currently in the works.
