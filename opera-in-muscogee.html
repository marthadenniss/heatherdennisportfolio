    <p>Kirsten C. Kunkle knew what her career as an opera singer would entail: traveling, rehearsing, acting, and singing in a language not her own.</p>

    <p>But then, the Toledo-born singer didn’t expect to do things like co-founding an opera company, writing librettos for operas, or composing songs and writing lyrics.</p>

    <p>She never thought she would sing in a grand opera in a language other than French, German, and Italian. She never thought she would sing in Muscogee, her mother’s native language and the one she’s been learning for a few years now — the one in which she sings lullabies to her 4-year-old daughter.</p>

    <p>“I never thought I'd get to sing in a native language opera, ever. I never even considered it,” Kunkle said.</p>

    <p>But on Oct. 27, she was at the Civic Center Music Hall in Oklahoma City, in a state that’s still called Indian Territory as 39 tribes call it home, to create a significant role in an opera written in the Chickasaw language by a Native American composer, Jerod Impichchaachaaha’ Tate, alongside three other Native American castmates.</p>

    <p><em>Loksi Shaali’</em>, or <em>Shell Shaker</em>, the opera composed by Tate, a significant Native American composer, had its world premiere in concert form before a crowded audience of Native Americans — and just about anyone else you could think of, Tate said.</p>

    <p>“It was in Indian Territory, in our current homeland,” he said. “That was really cool. But it was representative of the entire community. So we had lots of American Indians there, and lots of non-natives there, and people were equally impacted.”</p>

    <p>Impacted, affected, moved, happy, awed. A jumble of emotions that led to a proud, historical moment.</p>

    <p>“I am proud of the work. I'm proud of the composing,” Tate said. “The performance was unbelievably outstanding. The soloists were incredible. The chorus sounded phenomenal. The orchestra just killed it. The premieres at the Met [Metropolitan Opera House in New York City] aren’t this good.”</p>
