  <h1>The Ghost of Mildred Benson</h1>

  <p>It’s a case a 16-year-old girl detective would want to solve.</p>

  <p>These are the clues, according to the security guards who patrol The Blade building and the old Toledo Times just across the street: Whispering. Voices speaking when no one else is in the building. Whistling in an empty room.</p>

  <p>Could it be that something — or someone — otherworldly is afoot? Could it be that someone who once lived for the thrill of a deadline is still working on that next big story, even after their own deadline expired?</p>

  <p>Security guard John Jett thinks he knows what’s happening: Mildred Benson, the longtime reporter for both newspapers, as well as the author of some of the earliest Nancy Drew mysteries, is still on the case.</p>

  <h2>Behind the bylines</h2>

  <p>Mildred Wirt Benson was born in 1905 in Ladora, Iowa. She wrote 23 out of the 30 original Nancy Drew stories under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene, as well as other novels and short stories.</p>

  <p>She worked at The Toledo Times beginning in 1944, in the midst of World War II, and then at The Blade. Her beats included city hall and the federal and municipal courts.</p>

  <p>The Times began printing in 1849, was acquired by The Blade in 1930, and ceased publication in 1975. The building has been used for various functions, but it is mainly empty today. Still, visitors can almost hear the hum of electric typewriters — and the tapping of manuals — when they enter what would have been the newsroom and see the multitude of electric outlets poke up from the floor, like monuments to the heyday of print journalism.</p>

  <p>After her death, the Associated Press obituary said: “Despite failing eyesight and diminished hearing, she continued authoring a monthly column called ‘Millie Benson's Notebook,’ even after she was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1997. She was working on her column when she collapsed in The Blade newsroom, dying in what is now ProMedica Toledo Hospital."</p>

  <p>But would someone with a 58-year career in newspapers give up the ghost that easily?</p>

  <h2>On the hunt</h2>

  <p>Christopher Tillman, Ryan Miller, Sarah Chelten, Kat Chelten, and Josh Gavin comprise the Haunted Toledo team, but Mr. Tillman and Mr. Osenbaugh conducted the recent hunt at The Blade.</p>

  <p>After taking photos of the building one Friday afternoon, the two returned in the evening to tour the building with production director Mike Merem and to conduct interviews, one with Mr. Jett and one with a reporter who was still flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tillman said he visited several areas within The Blade, which began operation at 541 N. Superior St. in 1927 after Paul Block, Sr., purchased the paper in 1926. After touring The Blade, the ghost hunters, Mr. Merem, Mr. Jett, and the breathing reporter walked across the street to the empty Toledo Times building, the site of most of the reported paranormal activity.</p>

  <p>In addition to voices and doors opening and closing, security guards have reported more disturbing activity they tend to blame on Mrs. Benson.</p>

  <p>“A guard who used to work here said he was on patrol, and one of those long fluorescent light bulbs was leaning against the wall,” Mr. Jett recalled. “It just slipped off the wall toward him and smashed on the floor” after sliding a few feet.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jett recalled another notable incident at The Times building.</p>

  <p>“[Another guard who still works here] ... he was on the steps, I don’t recall if he was going up or down, but he was on the steps and felt somebody pushing him,” Mr. Jett said.</p>

  <p>The ghost hunters used several pieces of equipment: a REM pod, a voice recorder, a spirit box, plus the all-important camera. A REM pod, or radiating electromagnetism pod, produces its own electromagnetic field, and the lights flash when it detects something moving in or around its field. The spirit box uses fast-scanning radio frequencies to help communicate with spirits.</p>

  <p>Both are used extensively in ghost hunting, but the science of both is often dismissed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jett used his pendulum, which he said was being manipulated by the erstwhile reporter. But she — or anyone else not of this world — didn’t respond to the ghost hunters’ equipment.</p>

  <p>Or did they?</p>

  <p>The breathing reporter noticed a slight drop in temperature around her chair; at about the same time, the light on the REM pod weakly flashed red. That occurred at least three times.</p>

  <p>Mr. Merem debunked one possibility: Vents were not located anywhere near the site.</p>

  <p>Several times, Mr. Tillman said, he thought he heard a female voice say hello through the spirit box. After the evidence was reviewed, Mr. Tillman confirmed that, saying that same voice came through at other sites in The Blade building.</p>

  <p>After a period of time in the room in The Times building, the little group moved into another room, as if drawn there. Mr. Jett stayed with his pendulum to keep in contact with the spirit he believes is Mrs. Benson.</p>

  <p>The hunt ended at about midnight. No activity was reported the rest of the hunt.</p>

  <p>But, Mr. Tillman said, that doesn’t mean The Blade isn’t haunted.</p>

  <h2>No smoking gun</h2>

  <p>“The really interesting part of it was there was a few times you heard a woman’s voice underneath all the static of the spirit box, saying hello,” Mr. Tillman said. “To me it sounded like the same voice, same woman, and it’s more like an inquisitive voice. The strongest place was at the Times building.”</p>

  <p>He also had other evidence that wasn’t quite as dramatic.</p>

  <p>“There was just the basic fleeting at the corner of your eye,” he said. “Not necessarily full shadows, or fully formed shadow-type people, but little flashes of something.”</p>

  <p>And at The Times building he experienced other evidence that cannot be measured and can be dismissed the easiest.</p>

  <p>“It felt like there were someone just hanging out, that maybe thought the world forgot about them,” Mr. Tillman said. “Both buildings really deserve a closer look to really gather some more evidence.”</p>

  <p>Most ghost hunters spend hours in a building just waiting for something to happen. That it often doesn’t makes it easier for skeptics to dismiss the entire concept, he said.</p>

  <p>“[Ghosts] aren’t like circus animals that perform on command; they come out when they want to, they talk when they want to. Even though they’re in spirit form, they’re still people,” said Mr. Tillman, who began Haunted Toledo in 2017. “In this field of study there’s never going to be proof, not the kind of proof you can put in a court of law.</p>

  <p>“There is no smoking gun,” he said.</p>

  <p>And then, no matter what evidence a believer presents, the skeptics and nonbelievers will never be convinced unless they experience a phenomenon themselves, he said.</p>

  <p>“There are things [that] can’t be measured, like the overwhelming feeling that somebody is looking at you, staring at you,” Mr. Tillman said. “You can’t measure that. But you know it happened, you know that it’s real.”</p>

  <p>Still, investigators such as those in the Haunted Toledo team “need to pay more attention to what the skeptics are saying,” he said. “Because oftentimes they do come out with really good information that we need to pay attention to. They’re just as important in this field of study as the believers are.”</p>

  <p>The most haunted place the team has investigated was in a tiny house in Villisca, Iowa, Mr. Tillman said, where an ax-wielding maniac killed two adults and six children. But in Toledo, he said their most convincing evidence has been from the Toledo Repertoire Theatre, where a 7-year-old girl who, records say, was killed by a trolley, is still searching for her mother.</p>

  <p>“We took a break and left all of our recorders and cameras going,” he said. “We caught the voice of what sounded like a young child, a female, crying out for her mother.”</p>

  <p>But, the most important question is, at least for this story: Could the spirit of Mildred Benson still be showing up to work?</p>

  <p>“Anything’s possible,” Mr. Tillman said. “She spent a large part of her life at The Blade, she enjoyed that part of her life, so it’s possible that she returns every now and then to check on how the place is going and relive the memories.</p>

  <p>“You never know.”</p>

  <p>What he does know, he said, is that “Toledo is filled with incredible history. And underneath that history, is just a ton of really fascinating legends and ghost stories that are all tied to these historic moments.</p>

  <p>“It’s just like peeling back an onion, just one layer after another, one story after another. There are some amazing stories there.”</p>
